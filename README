I use this for my blog stats.
It processes common log format access log entries
and sends me an email once a day with yesterday's report.

Some stdin --> stdout filters:

	html.sh        lets HTML requests through filter
	bot.sh         let bot requests through filter
	nobot.sh       let non-bot requests through filter

Other files:

	botlist.txt    defines what a bot is.  (regex applied to user agent string)
	parseday.sh    give it a number of days ago and it outputs all access log entries for that day
	sync.sh        sync wwwreport directory from server to my localhost
	crontab.entry  the command that generates the report
